It can be triggered by a number of things, including our emotions, neurotransmitters in the brain, or the caffeinated beverages we consume.\r\nAcross four separate studies and using a mix of participants from western and eastern cultures, they compared coffee- and tea-related cues. They found that participants exposed to coffee-related cues perceived time as shorter and thought in more concrete, precise terms.\r\n\u201cPeople who experience physiological arousal \u2014 again, in this case as the result of priming and not drinking coffee itself \u2014 see the world in more specific, detailed terms,\u201d says Maglio, whose past research has looked at how uncertainty can affect our perception of time.\r\n\u201cThis has a number of implications for how people process information and make judgments and decisions.\u201d\r\nHowever, the effect was not as strong among participants who grew up in eastern cultures, which Maglio speculates is due to the reduced cultural dominance of coffee.\r\nNext steps for the research will look at associations people have for different foods and beverages.

On the way the style of tea changed considerably from being eaten to a cooked brew to a refined whisked froth of powdered leaf tissue to steeped leafs.\r\nTea was introduced to Japan at all stages and the two latter has continued to the present with some Japanese improvements. Eventually, tea spread to Europe and the rest of the world, first as Chinese green tea and later as so-called black tea produced in other parts of Asia and Africa for consumption especially in Western countries and parts of Asia different from the traditional tea producing countries of the Far East.\r\nWhile the consumption of both powdered tea and leaf tea and the accompanying culture has continued steadily in Japan over time, China shifted from one style to another with dynastic changes and eventually almost lost her tea culture completely during the Cultural Revolution. In the past 30 years we have seen a resurgence in tea cultivation, appreciation and culture in China, that in the last decade has come to play a central role in a general cultural renaissance of past dynasties. Inspiration for this development in tea comes mainly from Taiwan, where a particular Japanese aesthetic influence can be seen, as well as increasingly from Japan, which is the only place left with a fully developed powdered tea, Matcha, culture based on the practices of the Sung, however with Japanese characteristics and a fully developed philosophy and aesthetic based on traditional Eastern belief systems.\r\nSince WW II, the Japanese have made an effort to introduce Matcha and the accompanying tea ceremony culture to most of the world including China. In the last two decades we have seen an increasing interest in the West for green tea, and the last decade especially for Matcha. The demand for green tea and Matcha is growing rapidly throughout the world, not least in the Far East, due to the recognised health benefits, mental positive effects and the culture that comes with it. At the same time, we see an increasing demand\r\nin the West for high quality Chinese leaf teas and accompanied with an interest in the culture that comes with it.\r\nMost interestingly, there is a new trend to eat tea in the form of powdered Matcha in different ways. We thus see tea has made it full circle, and this new development is definitely here to stay.\r\nOverall, there is a general and growing trend towards more and better tea consumption the world over, accompanied by an interest in traditional Eastern philosophy, culture and aesthetics often combined with a spiritual quest for greater meaning and purpose in life, peace of mind and appreciation of nature, the arts and our fellow beings in a, by tea, induced harmony.", "pub_date": "2020-07-22T09:20:32.229Z", "author": 3, "group": 2, "image": "posts/tsaiga-qhQEyyHWrAQ-unsplash.jpg"}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 5, "fields": {"text": "Vitamin C content in Habanero pepper accessions (Capsicum chinense)\r\nFruits of Capsicum species (peppers) accumulate high amounts of ascorbic acid or vitamin C. C. chinense occurs in the Midwest and Northeast regions and the Amazon Basin (where its greatest genetic diversity is found). The objective of the present work was to quantify the vitamin C content in peppers of 22 accessions of C. chinense \u2018Habanero\u2019 from the Breeding Program of Embrapa Vegetable Crops. Vitamin C was extracted from mature fruits with TCEP-HCl (tris 2-carboxyethyl-phosphine hydrocloride) and its content determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Vitamin C content ranged from 54.1 to 129.8 mg/100 g. Accessions were divided into four heterogeneous groups of diversity. Vitamin C content of the first group varied between 116.2 and 129.8 mg/100 g; the second group ranged from 94.0 to 104.6 mg/100 g; the third group ranged from 76.7 to 87.5 mg/100 g; and the fourth group ranged from 54.1 to 66.6 mg/100 g. These results highlight the diversity of C. chinense collection in terms of vitamin C content.\r\nPeppers of the genus Capsicum were already used in the diet of pre- Colombian American peoples in many recipes, generally as part of sauces or as spice (Reifschneider & Ribeiro, 2008). Capsicum chinense occurs in the Brazilian Midwest and Northeast regions and in the Amazon Basin (where its greatest genetic diversity is found).\r\nSeveral bioactive substances are present in fruits of hot and sweet pepper plants, especially the alkaloid capsaicin (that gives pungency), vitamin E, pro-vitamin A carotenoids, flavonoids and other secondary metabolites with antioxidant properties (Perucka & Materska, 2003; Matsufuji et al., 2007; Oboh & Rocha, 2007; Sun et al., 2007; Topuz & Ozdemir, 2007; Menichini\r\net al., 2009). Fresh peppers are also excellent sources of ascorbic acid (vitamin C), which participates in several antioxidant processes in plants besides acting in the prevention of human chronic diseases, including certain types of cancer, coronary disorder, arteriosclerosis and cataracts (Howard et al., 2000).The hot peppers (including several representatives of C. chinense) have great importance in the American continent and in tropical regions of the world. These products are essential in Mexican, African and Asian cuisines. In Brazil, C. frutescens (malagueta pepper) and C. chinense (pimenta de cheiro), are irreplaceable ingredients in several regional dishes. The acaraj\u00e9 and vatap\u00e1 in Bahia state,\r\nthe chicken with okra in Minas Gerais state, the duck with tucupi in Par\u00e1 state and the fish stew and chowder in several coastal cities of the Northeast and Southeast are some examples (Ribeiro & Henz, 2008).\r\nOther lesser known varieties, like \u201cHabanero\u201d, have begun to gain a greater importance in Brazil. The varietal group of hot peppers like \u201cHabanero\u201d presents, nowadays, a growing demand in North America and European Economic Community. The high value of this product in the international market is a result of an offer historically lower to the demand and, for this reason, has aroused the interest of national private groups in the development of processed products in this segment.", "pub_date": "2020-07-22T09:30:09.788Z", "author": 3, "group": 2, "image": "posts/artem-beliaikin-mv9MFATGIsI-unsplash.jpg"}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 6, "fields": {"text": "Lake Baikal and its catchment basin belong to the unique geological systems of the world. Baikal is located in the central part of Eastern Siberia, near the conventional geographic center of Asia. The mountain hollow of the lake represents the most important natural boundary of Siberia. The borders of various floristic and faunal areas converge in this region, creating biogeocenoses that have no analogues. \r\nBaikal is one of the greatest lakes of our planet: the deepest (1637 meters) and the oldest (about 25 million years old), containing the largest number of endemics (more than 1,000 species) and representatives of flora and fauna (more than 2600 species), inhabiting the fresh water bodies of the Earth. The lake has a unique reserve of fresh water (23 615 cubic kilometers) and quality (20% of world reserves). \r\nThe antiquity of Baikal is the most remarkable feature. Taking into consideration deep relict endemism of the lake fauna, the huge amount of researchers determine its age in 20-30 million years. The vast majority of lakes, especially the lakes with glacial and bayou origin, live 10-15 thousand years, then they are filled with sediments, dragged out by fusions, and sooner or later they turn into swamps and then dry up. Investigations of recent years have allowed geophysicists to put forward a hypothesis that Baikal, on the contrary, is a nascent ocean. This hypothesis is confirmed by the fact that its shores diverge at a speed of up to 2 cm per year, just as the continents of Africa and South America, the shores of the Mediterranean and Red Seas, etc. In the Baikal region, significant magnetic anomalies along its axis were noted, alongside with the active movements of the earths crust. On a scale, these anomalies are comparable with similar anomalies in the area of the mid-Atlantic fault. The lake has many features inherent to the ocean - abyssal depths, huge mass of water, internal waves and seiches, tides, strong storms, high waves, expansion of the basin due to the expansion of the shores, large values of magnetic anomalies, etc. \r\nAnnually about 60 cubic kilometers of beautiful and unique water are reproduced in Baikal, which in some cases can be used instead of distilled. The rare purity of water is provided by the vital activity of its unique flora and fauna. The main properties of Baikal water are characterized as follows: there are very few dissolved and suspended mineral substances, negligible organic impurities, and a lot of oxygen. The total mineralization of water in Lake Baikal is 120 milligrams per liter, while in many other lakes it reaches 400 or more milligrams per liter. The total content of ions in the lake water is 96.7 milligrams per liter. \r\nTransparency depends from the purity of water. Baikal not only extremely clean, but also is the most transparent lake in the world. Baikal water transparency reaches 40 meters (tens of times more than in many other lakes), it happens in spring, after breaking of the ice. The water of the Sargasso Sea is a gold standard of the highest transparency, which is approaching the transparency of distilled water. Here the disc of Secchi disappears from sight at a record depth of 65 meters. Recent investigations have shown that at depths from 250 to 1200 meters the transparency of Baikal water is not less than in the Sargasso Sea. \r\nThe catchment basin of Lake Baikal covers an area of 541 thousand square kilometers (without the area of the Baikal water area - 31.5 thousand square kilometers). There are 240500 square kilometers of the basin of surface and underground runoff into Baikal is located on the territory of Russia. The rest of the catchment basin (300.5 thousand square kilometers) is within Mongolia. \r\nThe entire lake basin is a peculiar and very fragile natural geosystem, the basis of which is the lake system with its natural formation process of the purest waters of drinking quality.", "pub_date": "2020-07-22T09:48:33.038Z", "author": 2, "group": 1, "image": "posts/simon-berger-QC8YQsbmE2s-unsplash.jpg"}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 7, "fields": {"text": "Today @ Baikal lake", "pub_date": "2020-07-22T09:54:24.247Z", "author": 2, "group": 1, "image": "posts/irina-shishkina-E2StbdIYGRE-unsplash.jpg"}}]
